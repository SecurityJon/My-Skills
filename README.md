## None
You've heard of the technology and can probably be able to explain it broadly to a non-technical person. You may have used it and also may of read about some of the security issues that have occurred during its lifetime. That's about the limit of your knowledge though, you wouldn't be able to have a conversation with someone who regularly uses the technology without coming across as a bit of a 'noob'.

## Enough for a sales call / technical meeting
A sales person or management lead at your company needs a security expert with them to help out with a meeting which is starting in a few minutes. You know enough about the technology to be able to understand what is being said at the meeting and are able to ask some intelligent questions without coming across as a complete noob, but you wouldn't know where to begin performing a security test without a decent amount of studying.

## Could do the basics
An emergency has occurred and you have only three days to perform a security assurance exercise against the technology, starting tomorrow. You may have performed a test or two against this technology a long time ago, or you may have shadowed a colleague recently but any testing you conduct is going to be 80% google and you're unlikely to find anything apart from the low hanging fruit. Still, you know enough to cover the basics.

## Reasonably good
You're reasonably good with the technology. Either you've conducted multiple tests on this technology before, but it's been a while and you're a little rusty, or you've conducted a few recent tests and you're getting up to speed fast. If you were tasked with conducting a test tomorrow, you're pretty confident you could conduct a security review which would be 'good enough'

## On par with other experts
You're very comfortable with the technology and have conducted multiple security reviews against it recently. You're confident that if you were matched head-to-head against experts from other companies, you'd be able to stand toe-to-toe with them on a test.

## God like
You're world renowned for  this technology, this is your bread and butter. When someone in the infosec space thinks of this technology, yours is the name they'll think of for securing it. You've probably presented at a few conferences and may have even a few CVEs to your name here. Think Ian Coldwater for Kubernetes,  Andrew Tierney for hardware, Deviant Ollam for physical or Christian Herrmann for RFID
